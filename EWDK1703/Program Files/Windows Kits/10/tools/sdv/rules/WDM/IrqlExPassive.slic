Rule ID:

    0x00020008

Description:

    The IrqlExPassive rule specifies that the driver calls the following 
    executive support routines only at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL:
        ExCreateCallback
        ExIsProcessorFeaturePresent
        ExRaiseAccessViolation
        ExRaiseDatatypeMisalignment
        ExUuidCreate
    and these routines at IRQL<=APC_LEVEL:
        ExRaiseStatus
