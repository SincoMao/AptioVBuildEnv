Rule Name:

    CompletionRoutineRegistered

Domain:

    wdm

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule specifies that if the dispatch routine registers a
    completion routine using IoSetCompletionRoutineEx it must
    thereafter call IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver and not call
    IoSetCompletionRoutineEx or IoSetCompletionRoutine.

    Background:
    IoSetCompletionRoutineEx reserved a bit of memory.
    Calling IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver frees this memory up.
