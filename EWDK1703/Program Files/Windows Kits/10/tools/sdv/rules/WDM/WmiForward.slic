Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule is not applicable to bus drivers.  It verifies
    that before returning from a dispatch routine, if the IRP is a
    WMI_IRP with disposition IrpForward, then the driver should
    forward it to the lower driver. 
    This rule only applies to FDO and FIDO drivers.
