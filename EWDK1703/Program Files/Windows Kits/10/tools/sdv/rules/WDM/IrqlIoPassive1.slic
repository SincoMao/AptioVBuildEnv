Rule ID:

    0x0002000A

Description:

    The IrqlIoPassive1 rule specifies that the driver calls the following 
    routines only when it is executing at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL:
        IoAttachDevice
        IoCreateDevice
        IoCreateDeviceSecure (SDV)
        IoSetDeviceInterfaceState

    The rule also specifies that the driver calls the following routine only 
    when it is executing at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL and IRQL = APC_LEVEL:
        IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest
