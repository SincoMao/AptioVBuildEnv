    IoSetCompletionRoutineNonPnpDriver

Domain:

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    Non PNP drivers should use IoSetCompletionRoutineEx not IoSetCompletionRoutine.
	
    Background:
    IoSetIoCompletionEx avoids the actual driver IMAGE unloading once the driver has been marked for unload. 
    This applies to non-PNP drivers since they donï¿½t get notified by PNP when a remove/unload/etc is happening.
