Rule Name:

    DeleteDevice

Domain:

    wdm

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    Drivers should not rely on the IoManager or PnpManager keeping the DeviceObject alive after a call to IoDeleteDevice. 
    Drivers should call IoDeleteDevice after the lower driver has returned. This is the recommended behaviour.
    This rule applies to FDO and FIDO drivers.
