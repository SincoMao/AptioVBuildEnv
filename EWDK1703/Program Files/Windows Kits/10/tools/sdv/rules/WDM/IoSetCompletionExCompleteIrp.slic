Description:

    IoSetCompletionRoutineEx routine returns an NTSTATUS value. 
    The driver must check this value to determine if the IoCompletion routine 
    was successfully registered before calling IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver and 
    if IoSetCompletionRoutineEx fails then the IRP should be completed and 
    the dispatch routine should return .
    
    Background: IoSetCompletionRoutineEx routine returns an NTSTATUS value. 
    The driver must check this value to determine if the IoCompletion routine 
    was successfully registered before calling IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver and 
    if IoSetCompletionRoutineEx fails then the IRP should be completed and the 
    dispatch routine should return .
    
    The IRP is tracked (a.k.a., TRACKED_OBJECT). Use !irp .
