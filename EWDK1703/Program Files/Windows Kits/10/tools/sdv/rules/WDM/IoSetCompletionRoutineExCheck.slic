Rule Name:

    IoSetCompletionRoutineExCheck

Domain:

    wdm

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    IoSetCompletionRoutineEx routine returns an NTSTATUS value. The driver must check this value to determine if the IoCompletion routine was successfully registered
    before calling IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver.
	

    Background:
    If the IoCompletion routine is successfully registered, IoSetCompletionRoutineEx allocates memory that remains allocated until the IoCompletion routine executes. 
    Drivers must ensure that their IoCompletion routine executes by calling IoCallDriver or PoCallDriver otherwise, the kernel will leak memory.
