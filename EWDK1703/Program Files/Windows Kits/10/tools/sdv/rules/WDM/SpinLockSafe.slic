Rule Name:

    SpinLockSafe

Domain:

    Wdm

Rule ID:

    0x0004000C

Description:

    The SpinLockSafe rule specifies that IoStartNextPacket and 
    IoCompleteRequest are not called while holding a spin lock. 

    This rule also specifies that the driver calls KeAcquireSpinLock or 
    KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel before calling KeReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel 
    or KeReleaseSpinLock, and that it calls IoAcquireCancelSpinLock before 
    calling IoReleaseCancelSpinLock.
