Rule Name:

    IrqlKeReleaseSpinLock

Domain:

    Wdm

Rule ID:

    0x00020015

Description:

    The IrqlKeReleaseSpinLock rule specifies that the driver calls 
    KeReleaseSpinLock only when it is executing at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.

    This rule also specifies that the value of the NewIrql parameter in the 
    call to KeReleaseSpinLock is equal to the IRQL at which the driver was 
    executing before the call to KeAcquireSpinLock. (This value is also the 
    value of the OldIrql parameter that is supplied by KeAcquireSpinLock.)

/*

Calls to KeAcquireSpinLock and KeReleaseSpinLock must follow a stack
protocol (See general discussion of the SDV OS Model IRQL Stack in the
SDV OS Model).

Notice: The rule does not check that the previous IRQL was set by
KeAcquireSpinLock.

*/

/* Check that KeReleaseSpinLock is called at DISPATCH_LEVEL and that
it restores the IRQL to previous level: */
