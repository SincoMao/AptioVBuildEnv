Rule Name:

    DoubleExFreePool

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that the driver does not attempt to free the same 
    block of pool memory twice. The rule keeps track of the memory pointer
    first passed to ExFreePool. If the same pointer is passed again, the 
    driver fails the rule. If the driver calls RemoveHeadList or RemoveEntryList,
    the rule passes.
