Rule Name:

    StorPortBuildIo

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that if the StorPort miniport's BuildIo routine returns FALSE,
    the SRB in question is not passed to StartIo. (In such cases, 
    the miniport driver must complete the SRB by calling StorPortNotification 
    with a notification type of RequestComplete, from BuildIo or someplace else).
	
    Note: this rule is testing StorPort's correct operation, not miniport's.
