Rule Name:

    ZwRegistryCreate

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that the handle to a registry key created with ZwCreateKey 
    is subsequently used correctly by other ZwXxx routines. The ZwOpenKey routine
    must not be called on an already open handle. The routines
    ZwEnumerateKey, ZwEnumerateValueKey, ZwFlushKey, ZwQueryKey, ZwQueryValueKey,
    ZwSetValueKey, ZwClose, and ZwDeleteKey must not be called on a handle
    that isn't open. The handle must also be closed before returning.
