Rule Name:

    SpinLockSafe

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that the IoStartNextPacket and IoCompleteRequest routines 
    are not called while holding a spin lock. The rule keeps track of the number
    of spin locks held at any time, and if that number is not 0 when either 
    routine is called, the driver fails the rule.
