Rule Name:

    SpinLockRelease

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that the driver does not attempt to release a lock via 
    KeReleaseSpinLock without first acquiring it via KeAquireSpinlock 
    or KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc. The rule passes when the acquired spin lock
    is released.
