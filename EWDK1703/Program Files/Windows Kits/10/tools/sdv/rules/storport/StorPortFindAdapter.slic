Rule Name:

    StorPortFindAdapter

Domain:

    storport

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    
    The FindAdapter routine must set the MaximumTransferLength and NumberOfPhysicalBreaks 
    fields in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure. 
    By default, the value of both these fields is SP_UNINITIALIZED_VALUE.
    If either of these fields is still set to SP_UNINITIALIZED_VALUE upon exit from
    FindAdapter, the driver fails the rule.
