Rule Name:

    ReadReqs

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This Rule verifies that Read requests are not passed to 
    inappropriate KMDF request send DDIs.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    All requests presented to the driver in the WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_READ
    callback are guaranteed to be Read requests. Hence these cannot be sent using
    DDIs that are specific to sending read, write, ioctl, etc requests.
