Rule Name:

    DrvAckIoStop

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that driver is aware of pending requests while its power-managed queue
    is getting powered-down and acks or completes or cancels them accordingly. In the case of self-managed I/O driver should
    correctly handle these requests as well from EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoSuspend. Driver failing to handle these requests during a power-down would cause BSOD 9F.

    If driver doesn't hold on to the requests or forward them to other drivers and completes the requests 
    directly in the queue's handlers then it can use analysis_assume to suppress the SDV warning.
