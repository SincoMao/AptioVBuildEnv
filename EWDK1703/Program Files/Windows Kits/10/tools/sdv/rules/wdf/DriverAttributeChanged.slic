Rule Name:

    DriverAttributeChanged

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This Rule verifies that a driver does not change the execution level or synchronization scope for a KMDF driver.

            Changing the driver execution level or synchronization scope is not illegal.
            This rule should be treated as a warning. 
             
    Rule diagnostics:
    If the driverObject's execution level and/or synchronization scope are
    changed to anything other than the default, this rule finds a defect.
