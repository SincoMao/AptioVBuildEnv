Rule Name:

    DeviceInitAllocate

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:


    For a PDO device object, the framework device object 
    initialization method WdfPdoInitAllocate must 
    be called before the driver calls WdfDeviceCreate.
    

    For a PDO device object, the framework device object 
    initialization method WdfPdoInitAllocate must 
    be called before the driver calls WdfDeviceCreate.
  
    Rule diagnostics:
    "WdfPdoInitAllocate was not called before WdfDeviceCreate for the device."
 
    Related rules: PdoDeviceInitAPI, DeviceInitAPI.
    
    Note: 
    If the driver creates both a PDO device object, and the calls to     
    WdfPdoInitAllocate are missing, the rule will report the defect 
    for one of the WdfDeviceCreate calls (in fact, for the call that is earlier on the execution pass in the driver).
    Examples of such drivers are: a filter driver that is a bus driver; a bus driver that has a control device object.
