    EvtIoStopResume

Domain:

    wdf

Description:

    This rule checks that if a driver registers EvtIoStop and calls WdfRequestStopAcknowledge with $2 equal to false 
    then the driver's should register a EvtIoResume callback, as the framework will deliver requests to the EvtIoResume callback 
	when the device enter D0 state again.
