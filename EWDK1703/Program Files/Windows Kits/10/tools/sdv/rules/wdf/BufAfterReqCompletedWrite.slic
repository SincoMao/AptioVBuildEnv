Rule Name:

    BufAfterReqCompletedWrite

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    After a Request is completed, its Buffer cannot be accessed
    (inside EvtIoWrite callback only). The buffer was retrieved by calling 
    WdfRequestRetrieveInputBuffer or WdfRequestRetrieveOutputBuffer or
    WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserInputBuffer or WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserOutputBuffer.

    Within EvtIoWrite Io queue event callback, the Request Buffer retrieved by calling
    WdfRequestRetrieveInputBuffer or WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserInputBuffer
    cannot be accessed after WdfRequestComplete/WithInformation/WithPriorityBoost 
    on the Request. The following possible buffer access functions are considered:
    WdfRequestRetrieveOutputBuffer, WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserOutputBuffer, 
    WdfRequestRetrieveInputBuffer and WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserInputBuffer.
