Rule Name:

    SyncReqSend

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that all synchronous request sends are done using synchronous specific DDIs that
    have a non-zero timeout.

    If the driver calls WDFxxxSendXXXSynchronously without setting a valid timeout,
    the thread can be stalled if hardware does not respond promptly. Depending on the dispatch level at which 
    the thread is running, this can cause various other issues for the OS.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    The timeout value in the request options must be non-zero and the timeout flag must be set.
    If the driver fails to satisfy either of the above conditions, this rule reports a defect.
