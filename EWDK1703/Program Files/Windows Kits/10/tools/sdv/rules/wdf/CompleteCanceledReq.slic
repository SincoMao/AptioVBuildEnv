Rule Name:

    CompleteCanceledReq

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    Checks that the driver does not complete canceled requests.

    If the request has already been canceled, then it is no longer valid and the 
    driver may not complete it. If the request was previously marked cancelable,
    while unmarking it the driver must check that the request has not already been canceled. 
    If this check is not made the driver may complete a request that has been freed.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    If WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable returns STATUS_CANCELLED and the driver
    completes the request, this rule finds a defect.
