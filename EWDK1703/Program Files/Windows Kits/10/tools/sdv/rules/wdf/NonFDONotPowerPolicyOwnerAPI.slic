Rule Name:

    NonFDONotPowerPolicyOwnerAPI

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that if a non-FDO driver is not a power policy owner, certain DDIs cannot be called.

    If the precondition rule NotPowerPolicyOwner passes, and another precondition
    rule FDODriver finds a defect, the driver cannot call the following DDIs:
    WdfDeviceInitSetPowerPolicyEventCallbacks, WdfDeviceAssignS0IdleSettings,
    WdfDeviceAssignSxWakeSettings.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
        "The Driver is not a Power Policy Owner and cannot call $fname. For the rule to be applicable, 
         the precondition rule FDODriver should find a defect, and the precondition rule NotPowerPolicyOwner 
         should pass."
    
    Pre-conditions: NotPowerPolicyOwner.slic (pass),
    FDODriver.slic (fail).
