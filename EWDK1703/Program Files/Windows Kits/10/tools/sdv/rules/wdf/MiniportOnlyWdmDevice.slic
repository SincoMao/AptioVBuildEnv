Rule Name:

    MiniportOnlyWdmDevice

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    WDF drivers shouldn't use IoCreateDevice and IoCreateDeviceSecure functions to create bare WDM device objects. This will cause a BSOD if someone tries to send an IRP to the WDM device. 
    This is because IRP dispatch entries of the device are set to WDF specific entries but WDF haven't created a WDF device. However miniport drivers can use the DDI, because driver dispatch entry points aren't set for them.
