Rule Name:

    UsbDeviceCreateFail

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

   This rule verifies that the driver returns from EVT_WDF_DEVICE_PREPARE_HARDWARE
   with an error status if creation of a WDFUSBDEVICE fails.

    If the driver calls the WdfUsbTargetDeviceCreate DDI in 
    EvtDevicePrepareHardware, the driver is a USB driver. In order to perform 
    any usb specific operations, the creation of a WDFUSBDEVICE must have been successful.
    Hence, if this step fails and the driver does not report an error, the driver 
    has a defect.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    If EVT_WDF_DEVICE_PREPARE_HARDWARE returns a success status while WdfUsbTargetDeviceCreate
    returns a failure, this rule reports a defect.
