Rule Name:

    EvtSurpriseRemoveNoSuspendQueue

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    WDF Drivers shouldn't drain/stop/purge the Queue from EvtDeviceSurpriseRemoval callback, instead self-managed I/O callbacks should be used. EvtDeviceSurpriseRemoval callback isn't synchronized with the power-down path.

    Rule diagnostics:
    If driver drains/stops/purges the Queue from EvtDeviceSurpriseRemoval callback, then rule fails.
