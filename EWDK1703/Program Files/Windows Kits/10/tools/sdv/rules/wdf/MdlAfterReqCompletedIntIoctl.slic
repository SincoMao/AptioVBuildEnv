Rule Name:

    MdlAfterReqCompletedIntIoctl

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    After a Request is completed, the associated Mdl object
    cannot be accessed (inside Internal Ioctl callback only).
    Mdl object was retrieved by calling WdfRequestRetrieveOutputWdmMdl or 
    WdfRequestRetrieveInputWdmMdl.

    Within internal Ioctl Io queue event callback, the Mdl object associated with the
    Request by calling WdfRequestRetrieveOutputWdmMdl or WdfRequestRetrieveInputWdmMdl,
    cannot be accessed after WdfRequestComplete/WithInformation/WithPriorityBoost 
    on the Request.
    The following possible Mdl object access functions are considered:
    WdfRequestRetrieveOutputWdmMdl, WdfRequestRetrieveInputWdmMdl.
