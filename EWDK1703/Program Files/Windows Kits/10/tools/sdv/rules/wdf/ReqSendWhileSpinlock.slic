Rule Name:

    ReqSendWhileSpinlock

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that no requests are sent while the driver holds a spinlock.
    
    If the driver sends any requests while holding a spinlock, this could cause a 
    deadlock or clash with the lower driver that receives the requests, if the lower
    driver also attempts to acquire a lock or access shared resources.
    
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    This rule assumes the driver makes correct use of acquiring and releasing spinlocks.
    If WdfRequestSend is called while holding a spinlock, this rule reports a defect.
