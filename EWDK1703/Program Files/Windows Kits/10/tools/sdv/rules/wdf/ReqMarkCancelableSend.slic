Rule Name:

    ReqMarkCancelableSend

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that requests forwarded by the driver are not marked CANCELABLE by calling WdfRequestMarkCancelable.
    
    In order to mark the request as cancelable, the driver must own the request.
    Once the request is sent to another driver, it no longer has ownership and must
    call WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable on the request if it was previously marked cancelable.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    If a request is sent while still marked cancelable, this rule finds a defect.
