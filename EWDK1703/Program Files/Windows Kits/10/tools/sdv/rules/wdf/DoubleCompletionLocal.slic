Rule Name:

    DoubleCompletionLocal

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that drivers do not complete a request twice.

    The WdfCompleteRequest, WdfCompleteRequestWithInformation, or WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost  
    must not be called twice in a row for the same request. 
    This is the same rule as the DoubleCompletion rule, the difference is that this rule
    is only performed within the default I/O queue callback functions.
