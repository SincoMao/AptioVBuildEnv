Rule Name:

    MarkCancOnCancReqLocal

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    The WdfRequestMarkCancelable method can only be called on a request
    that had not been marked cancelable.
    
    Diagnostic message: 
    "Warning: WdfRequestMarkCancelable cannot be called 
        twice in a row on the same Request." 
    
    
    Note 1: This rule does the check only within the default I/O queue callback functions.
    The rule MarkCancOnCancReq performs this check globally (in both I/O queue
    callback functions and deferred processing callback functions).
