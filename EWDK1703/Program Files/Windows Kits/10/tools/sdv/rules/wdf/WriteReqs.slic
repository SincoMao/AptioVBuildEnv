Rule Name:

    WriteReqs

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    Rule verifies that a write request is not passed to 
    inappropriate request-send DDIs
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    All requests presented to the driver in the EVT_WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_WRITE
    callback are guaranteed to be write requests. Hence, these requests cannot be sent using
    DDIs specifically for sending read, IOCTL, etc requests. If the same request that is
    received from the framework is passed to any such DDI, then this rule reports a defect.
