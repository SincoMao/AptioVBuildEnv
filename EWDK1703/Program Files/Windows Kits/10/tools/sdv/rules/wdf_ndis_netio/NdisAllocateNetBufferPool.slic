Rule Name:

    NdisAllocateNetBufferPool

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule checks that NdisAllocateNetBufferPool and NdisFreeNetBufferListPool are called 
    in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure all NetBufferPool are freed
    when MiniportHaltEx ends.

    The rule uses three different states. state changes when a NetBuffer is allocated or freed.
    If a NetBufferPool is still allocated when the MiniportHaltEx exits, then the rule will fail.
