Rule Name:

    NdisAllocateNetBuffer

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule checks that NdisAllocateNetBuffer and NdisFreeNetBuffer are called 
    in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure all NetBuffer are freed
    when MiniportHaltEx ends.

    The rule uses three different states. state changes when a NetBuffer is allocated or freed.
    If a NetBuffer is still allocated when the MiniportHaltEx exits, then the rule will fail.
