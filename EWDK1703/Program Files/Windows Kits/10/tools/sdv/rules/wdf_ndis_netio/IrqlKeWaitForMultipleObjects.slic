Rule Name:

    IrqlKeWaitForMultipleObjects

Domain:

    Wdm

Rule ID:

    0x00020021

Description:

    The IrqlKeWaitForMultipleObjects rule specifies that the driver calls the 
    KeWaitForMultipleObjects routine at the proper IRQL based on the value of 
    the Timeout parameter: 

        If Timeout points to a zero value, the driver is executing at 
        IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.

        If Timeout is NULL, or points to any value other than zero, 
        the driver is executing at IRQL <= APC_LEVEL.
