Rule Name:

    NdisAllocateNetBufferList2

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule checks that NdisAllocateNetBufferList and NdisFreeNetBufferList are called 
    in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure all NetBufferLists are freed
    when MiniportHaltEx ends.

    The rule uses three different states. state changes when a NetBuffer is allocated or freed.
    If a NetBufferList is still allocated when the MiniportHaltEx exits, then the rule will fail.
