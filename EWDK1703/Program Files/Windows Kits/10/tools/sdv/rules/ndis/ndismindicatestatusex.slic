    NdisAllocateCloneNetBufferList

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    The driver must not call NdisMIndicateStatusEx after it returns from the MiniportHaltEx function. See MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff563600(v=vs.85).aspx

    The NdisMIndicateStatusEx function reports a change in the status of a miniport adapter.
    When a miniport driver calls NdisMIndicateStatusEx, NDIS calls each bound protocol driver's ProtocolStatusEx function. 
    This allows a bound protocol driver to log the change in status of an underlying miniport adapter or to take action.

    A miniport driver can call NdisMIndicateStatusEx after setting its registration attributes even if the driver is still in the context of the MiniportInitializeEx function. 
    The driver must not call NdisMIndicateStatusEx after it returns from the MiniportHaltEx function.
