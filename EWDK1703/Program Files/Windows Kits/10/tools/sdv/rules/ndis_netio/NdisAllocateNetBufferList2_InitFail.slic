Rule Name:

    NdisAllocateNetBufferList2_InitFail

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule checks that NdisAllocateNetBufferList and NdisFreeNetBufferList are called 
    in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure all NetBufferLists are freed
    when the initialization functions fails.

    The rule uses three different states. state changes when a NetBuffer is allocated or freed.
    If a NetBufferList is still allocated when the MiniportHaltEx exits, then the rule will fail.
