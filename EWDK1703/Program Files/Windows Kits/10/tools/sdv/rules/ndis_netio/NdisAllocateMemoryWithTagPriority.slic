Rule Name:

    NdisAllocateMemoryWithTagPriority

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    The NdisAllocateMemoryWithTagPriority rule specifies that a driver must not call NdisAllocateMemoryWithTagPriority without providing a Tag.
    Every memory allocation should use a unique pool tag to ensure that kernel debuggers and Driver Verifier can identify a distinct allocated block of memory.

    According to the documentation : 
        "Specifies the pool tag for the allocated memory. Specify the pool tag as a character 
         literal of up to four characters delimited by single quotation marks (for example, 'Tag1'). 
         The string is usually specified in reverse order (for example, 'Tag1'). The ASCII value 
         of each character in the tag must be between 0 and 127. Every allocation code path should 
         use a unique pool tag to ensure that debuggers and verifiers identify a distinct allocated block."
    
    Moreover the underlying kernel call will assert.
