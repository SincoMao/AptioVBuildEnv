Rule Name:

    NdisOpenConfigurationEx

Domain:

    ndis

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule checks that NdisOpenConfigurationEx and NdisCloseConfiguration are called 
    in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure that conifguration handles are closed
    when MiniportHaltEx ends.
    
    Description:
    The rule uses three different states. State changes when a configuraion is opened or closed.
    If a configuration handle is still open when the MiniportHaltEx exits, then the rule will fail.
