;memcpy - Copy source buffer to destination buffer
;
;Purpose:
;       memcpy() copies a source memory buffer to a destination memory buffer.
;       This routine does NOT recognize overlapping buffers, and thus can lead
;       to propogation.
;       For cases where propogation must be avoided, memmove() must be used.
;
;       Algorithm:
;
;       void * memcpy(void * dst, void * src, size_t count)
;       {
;               void * ret = dst;
;
;               /*
;                * copy from lower addresses to higher addresses
;                */
;               while (count--)
;                       *dst++ = *src++;
;
;               return(ret);

; with just two stores is handled with just two stores, the regular code
; will always do 3 stores for unaligned moves that have a remainder.
; No assumptions are made here about buffer alignment or overlap.
; We load the entire string to be moved in 2 xmm registers before storing
; anything, so this works for any arrangement of overlapping buffers.

; dst is in rcx (can modify) and r11 (must preserve for return value)

; When length < 32 the first 16 bytes includes some of the last 16 bytes
; and we will store (length - 32) bytes twice. (E.g. in the worst case
; of len 17 we are storing the middle 15 bytes of the buffer twice).
; This is still much faster than doing logic and branching with 1, 2, 4
; and 8 byte conditional copies.

; Preconditions:
;       destination in rcx (destructable) and r11 (must preserve for return value)
;       source in r10
;       length in r8, must be greater than 16
;       offset from dest to src in rdx
;       source addr > dest addr or else buffers don't overlap
;
; Aligned stores are much faster on AMD hardware, so start by moving however many
; bytes must be moved so updated dst is 16-byte aligned. We need to copy
; (16 - (dest mod 16)) bytes, but it's faster to just do an unaligned copy of 16
; bytes and then start the aligned loop as usual at ((dest - (dest mod 16)) + 16).
; This results in (dest mod 16) bytes being copied twice. This is a lot faster
; than a bunch of code to copy maybe 1 then maybe 2 then maybe 4 then maybe 8
; bytes to achieve dst alignement.
;
; We know the src address is greater than the dst, but not by how much. In the
; case where the difference is less than 16 we must be careful about the bytes
; that will be stored twice. We must do both loads before either store, or the
; second load of those bytes will get the wrong values. We handle this by
; loading the last 16 bytes that can be stored at an aligned address, but
; deferring the store of those bytes to the remainder code, so it can load the
; remainder before storing the deferred bytes. Since either or both of the two
; loops can be skipped, the preconditions needed by the remainder  code must
; also apply to the loops. These conditions are:
;  - r8 is the count remaining, not including the deferred bytes
;  - [rcx + rdx] and [rcx] as usual point to the src and dst where the number
;    number of bytes given by r8 should be copied from and to.
;  - xmm0 holds the 16 deferred bytes that need to be stored at (-16)[rcx]

;       source in r10 (must preserve for remainder move)
;       length in r8, must have been verified to be greater than 16

; Aligned stores using movaps or movups are faster on AMD hardware than unaligned
; stores using movups. To achieve 16-byte dest alignment, we do an unaligned move
; of the last 16 bytes of the buffers, then reduce rcx only by the amount necessary
; to achieve alignment. This results in some bytes getting copied twice, unless we're
; already aligned.
;
; We know the src address is less than the dst, but not by exactly how much. In the
; case where the difference is less than 16 we must be careful about the bytes
; that will be stored twice. We must do both loads before either store, or the
; second load of those bytes will get the wrong values. We handle this by
; deferring the store of 16 aligned bytes to the remainder code, so it can load the
; remainder before storing the deferred bytes. Since either or both of the two
; loops can be skipped, the preconditions needed by the remainder  code must
; also apply to the loops. These conditions are:
;  - r8 is the count remaining, not including the deferred bytes
;  - [rcx] points one past the end of the remainder bytes
;  - rdx is the offset from the dst to the source
;  - xmm0 holds the 16 deferred bytes that need to be stored at [rcx]
